# EXcon - Expert Consultant

## I. Introduction
**EXcon (Expert Consultant)** is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to connect users with experts in various fields for professional consultations. The app allows users to browse experts, reserve appointments, and chat with them seamlessly.

This project was my **first semi-serious university Flutter application**, developed in **2023** during my **third year of university**, after just **two months of learning Flutter**. I designed the UI entirely by myself, without relying on any UI/UX guidelines. Despite that, the app features **smooth animations and a visually appealing interface** for a first serious project.
